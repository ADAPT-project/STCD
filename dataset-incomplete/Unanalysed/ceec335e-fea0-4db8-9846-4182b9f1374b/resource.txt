Healthy minds

Fresh air. A golden sunset. Leaves crunching underfoot.
A good walk can do wonders at the end of a long, stressful and tiring day. 
 
But it's not just about the occasional one-off feel good factor. Walking is great for keeping our minds healthy in the long-term too. Because when we walk - just like when we do any kind of exercise - our brains release chemicals that make us feel good. And that means walking can help us cope with things like depression, stress and anxiety. 

    Walking has always been there for me, my confidence has grown immensely. I'm a totally different person now than I was ten years ago and I owe so much of that to walking.

Invest in your long-term health now and you’ll see the difference that walking can make to your mind, your body and your social life. Walking in a group is a great way to start started and stay motivated, so find your local Walking for Health scheme and get started now.
