Why Not Walk More?
Your Reasons.....
"I don't have the time"

Walking is by far the easiest exercise to fit into a busy lifestyle since you can do it anywhere, at any time that suits you.  Every minute you spend waling is quality time, rather than sweating on a packed bus or train or fuming in a traffic jam.  You’ll still have to make a little effort to find time, but remember active people live longer and have a healthier old age – so think of your walking time as a good investment.
"I don't know any good places to walk"

Sometimes main roads don’t feel pleasant and safe for walkers.  But there are plenty of quieter streets, paths, parks, waterside and green spaces, even in urban areas if you know where to look for them.
"I don’t feel safe on the streets"

It’s understandable that people are concerned for their personal safety and security – but it’s a great shame if this stops you enjoying the benefits of walking.  If you can, walk with a companion  - the more people that walk, the safer the streets will be.
"I don’t have anyone to walk with"

Why not ask your family, friends and colleagues if they are interested in walking with you?  Or try an organised programme of led walks.  Find out more about groups in your area.
"I’m too unhealthy to walk"

Walking is a natural and undemanding exercise and you can start off by doing very little and building up slowly, so it’s perfect for people who are seriously unfit or recovering from illness.  Very few people are so unfit that they’d endanger themselves by walking – but, as with any other exercise programme, if you  have any doubts talk to your doctor first.
"My kids won't walk!"

Exercise is essential for children but it can be difficult to get them from their games consoles"  See Walking with Children for guidance

"I didn't think I would enjoy walking, but I took my young son and now I just can't stop thinking of ideas and places for us to walk to".  Peter, Edinburgh
