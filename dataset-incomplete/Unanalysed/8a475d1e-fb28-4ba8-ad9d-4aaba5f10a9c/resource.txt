Car Club
Car Club operator Co-Wheels has six vehicles available for public hire in Dumfries and 2 in Moffat.

What is a Car Club?

Car clubs give people a safer, cleaner and greener way to access cars when they need them.

Will it work for me?

The car club is a great option for everyone but it makes even more sense if you...

    Own a vehicle but use it infrequently
    Need access to a second vehicle but don't want the expense of owning one
    Are likely to need car hire at any time
    Need access to a 7 seater
    Want to avoid the costs of owning a vehicle including unexpected repair bills
    Are a young driver facing high insurance costs for owning your own vehicle
    Want to "go green" and give up your own vehicle
    Want access to vehicles throughout the UK

They are easily accessible, parked in their own designated parking bays across town at the train station, DGOne and Ewart Library. You'll never have to fight for a parking space again!

It's very simple to use. Maintenance, paperwork, insurance and tax are all included! And you just need to use a smart card to unlock the car.

It's a cheaper alternative to running your own car. Research has shown that it can save drivers as much as Â£3,500 a year!
