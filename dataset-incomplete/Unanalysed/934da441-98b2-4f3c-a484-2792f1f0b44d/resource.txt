Your cycling fallacy is…
Everyone needs to share the road
“If everyone just shared the road nicely, there wouldn’t be a problem”
The response

This appeal to better nature has been tried again and again, without any sign of success. For over 100 years there have been attempts to encourage considerate behaviour on the road – and nothing has changed.

From John Burns MP suggesting in 1913 that people should “show, in the most sportsmanlike way, the spirit of the road,” to the 1950s film Don't be Rude on the Road, which suggested “how nice it would be if people showed a little more courtesy,” to Scotland's 2013 Nice Way Code advertisements and beyond, such campaigns have a long history of failure.

Even if, by some miracle, we managed to get everyone to behave perfectly, cycling on busy roads will be still be an unappealing prospect for most people, due to the noise and delays inherent to motor vehicles. And “sharing the road” could never be a realistic option for many in society, such as children and people with mobility difficulties.

The only proven method to make cycling safe and attractive is by separating motor traffic from other modes of transport, by way of cycleways along main roads, and filtering minor roads to restrict through-motor-traffic.

Your cycling fallacy is…
We need more cycle training, not cycling infrastructure
“If people were trained to cycle on the road, there would be no need for cycling infrastructure”
The response

When people who don't cycle are asked why they don't, the reason most frequently given is worries about safety, fear of motor traffic in particular. Training is not, and cannot be, a substitute for a safe and attractive cycling environment.

While cycle training may help to instill confidence in the few who choose to do it, there is a lack of evidence to suggest that it will persuade those who are unwilling or uninterested to begin cycling, or to continue to do so once they have received training.

Cycle training does form part of the school curriculum in the Netherlands. However, it is not a tool to ‘encourage’ Dutch children to cycle. Instead, it involves teaching road rules to children who have already been cycling from a very young age. It is the quality of the cycling environment that is of fundamental importance in establishing (and maintaining) high cycling levels, not cycle training.

Your cycling fallacy is…
The weather isn’t right
“It’s too wet / dry / windy / hot / cold to cycle where I live”
The response

If it’s too cold, or wet, or hot to cycle, then it’s generally too cold, or wet, or hot to go out at all. When the streets are designed well, you are no more at the mercy of the weather when cycling, than you are when walking.

The Netherlands and Denmark routinely experience very cold winters, but good management of conditions, including clearing snow from major cycle routes, ensures that cycling remains practical as a mode of transport for most people. People still walk there when it's rainy, or cold, or hot – and they still cycle too.

While there may be some places with such extreme conditions that cycling is genuinely difficult, for most places this isn't true, and in no way justifies failing to provide a safe and attractive environment for cycling.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People should wear helmets when cycling
“People should wear helmets when cycling, that would make it safe”
The response

Wearing a helmet has been shown to make little difference to overall cycling safety. Countries with mandatory helmet laws, or high levels of helmet usage, show no reduction in head injuries (or injuries overall) compared to countries or areas without these laws.

Where streets and roads are designed well, cycling is such a subjectively safe activity that people feel as comfortable cycling as if they were going out in a car, or on a bus, or walking about. Good quality infrastructure has a far higher effect on cycling rates and safety than personal protective equipment.

Conversely, in some parts of the world the environment is so hostile to cycling that many people may feel there is no option but to wear a helmet or other equipment, even if it should only offer the most minor improvement in safety. A high rate of helmet use is a sign that the authorities have failed to design well for cycling.

The mandating of helmet use is proven to have a negative impact: it discourages people from cycling, thus reducing the societal benefit accruing from a healthier, more active population. It should be an individual's choice whether to wear a helmet, or indeed any other form of protective gear.

The effect of good infrastructure cannot be ignored: the Netherlands – which is the safest country in the world for cycling, with the widest demographic of people who cycle – also has the lowest rate of helmet use. Anyone who truly cares about cycling safety should campaign for infrastructure, first and foremost.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Cycling infrastructure slows down cycling
“Cycleways and other facilities slow you down, to cycle fast you must use the road”
The response

Badly-designed cycling infrastructure may be unsuitable for efficient cycling, but well-designed cycling infrastructure will and accommodate faster speeds. There is no fundamental reason why cycling infrastructure should not allow people to cycle fast and efficiently.

More importantly, good cycling infrastructure will make journeys quicker overall. It allows easy passage through streets clogged with motor traffic, and by prioritising cycling at traffic lights, allowing ‘free’ unsignalled turns, and unravelling cycling routes from motor vehicle routes (meaning no traffic lights at all), journeys can be made quicker and more efficient than an equivalent trip on the road network.

Creating high-quality cycling infrastructure – with elements like bus-stop bypasses – not only makes cycling journeys more comfortable, with less stopping and starting, but also reduces conflict with people using other modes of transport.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Cycling causes danger to people walking
“People cycle on footways, causing danger to those walking”
The response

Although cycling on footways can be prevalent in some areas, it is almost always a symptom of poor conditions for cycling.

The best and most permanent way to tackle this problem is to create attractive places for cycling away from the footway, either in the form of cycleways separated from motor traffic, or by making the road itself a pleasant place to cycle by reducing the speed and volume of motor traffic to a low level.

And while cycling on the footway can be genuinely annoying, scary and inconvenient for those walking, the danger it causes should not be overstated either – the vast majority of deaths and injuries on the footway are due to motor vehicles. People in the UK are over 50 times more likely to be killed by someone driving a motor vehicle on the verge or footway, than by someone cycling.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
It’s too expensive to provide for cycling
“Cycling facilities cost a lot of money and are a poor return on investment”
The response

Good cycling infrastructure does cost money, but it is incorrect to say it is a large amount in the scope of overall transport spending, or that it is a poor return on investment. Cycling infrastructure has been shown to pay back to society more than it costs – a 2014 UK government report cited returns of between 2:1 and 35:1.

Other countries demonstrate returns of 10 times or higher, and London's transport authority reports ratios of 20:1 for cycling investment. Whilst many of the UK figures are for ‘general’ investment in cycling (i.e. including training, etc.) the higher cost of cycling infrastructure is still justified because of the additional numbers drawn to cycling by the provision of safe places to cycle.

The Netherlands spends €500m per year on cycling infrastructure, which generates €31bn in health benefits alone – a 60:1 return on investment.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People don't use cycling facilities that already exist
“When cycling facilities are built, people often don’t use them, but cycle on the road anyway”
The response

This can often be true – many cycling facilities around the world are of a poor standard, failing to enable safe, simple, uncomplicated journeys. Some people who choose to cycle anyway will typically avoid poor-quality cycling infrastructure, because their journey would otherwise be slower and more difficult than just riding on the road.

In fact this is an argument for creating high quality cycling infrastructure which people will choose to use: well-designed facilities typically see significant uptake – for example in the UK, the new cycleways in London, or the Bristol-Bath cycleway.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Higher standards of driving would make cycling safe
“Higher standards of driving, through training and testing, would allow everyone to share the road safely”
The response

Higher standards of driving, due to improved training and more stringent testing, may help to make cycling a little safer. However, countless attempts have been made for over 80 years to get people to “share the road” safely, with little or no success.

While there will always be an anti-social and aggressive minority who will resist ‘education’, even the best-trained and best-intentioned people can make genuine mistakes when driving – human beings are not perfect, and motor vehicles are potentially dangerous machines.

It is fear of motor traffic itself that overwhelmingly discourages people from cycling, not just bad driving specifically. No amount of driver training will relieve these genuine worries, because the end result still involves someone on a light, low-powered machine trying to share roads which are dominated by high-powered vehicles weighing hundreds of kilograms and travelling much faster.

Even if 100% perfect driving could be achieved, cycling in motor traffic would remain an unpleasant and intimidating experience for most people, as it involves interacting with fast, heavy machines at close range. The most sensible – and proven to be safest – strategy to enable cycling is to limit the number of interactions with motor vehicles, through good design which separates cycling from driving as much as possible.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People break the rules when cycling
“People frequently break the rules of the road when cycling (ignoring red lights, etc.)”
The response

Much attention is paid to the issue of people cycling through stop signals, whereas the truth is that, regardless of the mode of travel used, some people will break traffic rules. People are no more likely to break traffic laws when they are cycling than when they are driving or walking.

There is also evidence to suggest that intentionally cycling through a red stop light can be safer where the road design is poor, usually because the environment has been designed only with motor vehicles in mind. Thus the most visible form of “red light jumping” by people cycling is when someone sets off before the traffic signals turn green, in order to safely pass through the junction before motor traffic begins moving. The rule-breaking behaviour is often a reaction to a dangerously-designed environment.

Good public infrastructure, designed with cycling in mind as a valid mode of transport, makes rule-breaking less attractive and/or necessary. The bad behaviour of some should not be used as an argument against improving conditions for all.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Cycling causes congestion
“People cycling cause congestion / Providing for cycling won't ease congestion”
The response

While driving behind someone cycling is going to slow you down if you're in a car or on a bus, it is unlikely this is going to add any overall delay to your journey. Congestion on roads is due to motor traffic, and in particular, queues at junctions. You will arrive at the tail end of that queue in exactly the same position – driving behind someone cycling has not cost you any extra time.

In general, congestion is nothing to do with cycling, but is a direct function of the volume of motor traffic on the roads. Were this not the case, then we would only see congestion on urban roads, and never on motorways (where nobody cycles).

Reallocating space on roads for cycling will actually make roads more efficient at moving people – a typical motor vehicle lane can carry around 2,000 people per hour, but the same space allocated for cycling infrastructure could carry around 10,000 people per hour.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Cycling infrastructure is unsafe
“I don't use cycleways because they're dangerous”
The response

It is true that cycleways in many countries are unsafe, or of a low quality. But this doesn’t mean cycleways have to be this way.

We know how to design them properly, for safe, comfortable and efficient cycling – we just need to look at how cycling infrastructure is designed in the Netherlands and Denmark. These two countries, which have the highest density of cycleways, have the best cycling safety record by far.

Good cycling infrastructure reduces interactions with motor vehicles to an absolute minimum, and ensures that where interactions have to occur, they take place at slow speeds, with good visbility and clarity about how people should behave.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
We need more electric cars
“More cycling won’t help – electric cars will fix all our transport problems”
The response

A shift from oil-powered cars to electric cars should certainly help to alleviate the problem of air pollution in urban areas.

However, electric cars don’t solve many of the other problems involved with motor vehicle use – congestion, danger, public health, land use required for parking, and roads and streets that are blighted by motor traffic.

Furthermore, there is evidence that particulates from tyres, brakes and engine wear can contribute significantly to local air pollution. The source of electricity also varies greatly around the world, so while clean, renewable energy is available in some areas, many places still rely on dirty sources of fuel for electricity generation.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
We’ll be stuck on terrible cycle paths
“If I support cycling facilities, they’ll be terrible, and I’ll be forced to use them, which is even more dangerous”
The response

This is really an argument for demanding excellent facilities – not for demanding none at all!

Cycling should be a mode of transport available to everyone – the Netherlands and Denmark have demonstrated that this is possible.

To oppose good-quality cycling infrastructure is to condemn cycling to remain a niche mode of transport which is only available to a hardened minority – as has happened in the US and UK.

Furthermore, indifference or negativity towards cycling infrastructure has not stopped terrible facilities from being built.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People should cycle at the side of the road, not in the middle
“People who cycle in the middle of the road delay traffic and endanger themselves – they should stay at the side”
The response

Nobody actually wants to ride in front of motor vehicles. However, poor road design often means that it is the safest place to cycle.

For instance, there might be parked cars that need to be given a wide berth (car doors can be opened at any time), or there might be dangerously narrow ‘pinch points’ where it would not be possible for a car driver to overtake safely. Cycling out from the side of the road might be annoying to some, but it is almost always done for sensible reasons, and is entirely legal in most of the world.

The best way to reduce this kind of conflict is to design roads that separate cycling and driving, so that these two different modes of transport are not in constant conflict.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People who cycle don't pay for the roads
“There shouldn't be any provision for cycling because people who cycle don’t pay for the roads”
The response

More cycling benefits everybody in society, even those who never travel by that method. More people getting around by cycling means fewer cars in traffic jams, more space on public transport, less motor-caused pollution, and a healthier population in general.

It's also worth considering that most people who cycle do also use motor vehicles – very few people travel exclusively by one mode of transport – and are therefore also paying motoring taxes. Cycling also causes almost no damage to the roads, which therefore require fewer repairs.

In most countries, highway networks are built, repaired and maintained from general taxation, and the duties paid for fuel, vehicle taxes, etc., are used for a variety of purposes, like any other tax. Even if motoring taxes were hypothecated exclusively to 'pay for roads', that would still leave a huge financial black hole for the social and societal costs of driving, such as the harm caused by pollution and collisions.

In any case, we don't expect people who walk anywhere to pay a tax for walking along footways – so cycling should be no different, especially as more cycling benefits everyone in society. Similarly, should only people who travel at night be expected to pay for street lighting, or does it benefit us all?

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Bus lanes provide good conditions for cycling
“People cycling are allowed to share bus lanes, which are wide and fast, so there's no need for cycling-specific infrastructure”
The response

People who already have the confidence to cycle amongst heavy motor traffic may find bus lanes to be a suitable environment in which to ride. Indeed, for those people, bus lanes can offer many benefits over a general traffic lane.

But for the vast majority who don't fit this narrow demographic, sharing space with large vehicles such as buses is deeply unappealing. Additionally, because of their size and mass, buses also represent genuine danger to people cycling.

Furthermore, the stop-start nature of bus journeys isn't compatible with the constant speed of cycling, which results in a 'leap-frog' situation, where the person cycling overtakes the bus at stops, meaning the bus has to try and overtake between the stops. In other words, buses hold up cycling, and vice versa.

If large numbers of the population were to take up cycling in bus lanes, the bus system would become unviable, as buses would be delayed due to too many people cycling – so cycling in bus lanes is not a realistic long-term solution for cycling.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People should wear hi-viz when cycling
“People should wear hi-viz to be safe when cycling”
The response

It's received wisdom that high-visibility garments make people cycling easily visible, and therefore safe.

But the evidence just doesn't show this at all. Studies suggest that high-visibility clothing has little or no effect on cycling safety, or on the behaviour of people driving. Furthermore, there may be some instances where such clothing actually worsens visibility – there have been instances where high-visibility clothing has been cited as an exacerbating factor in road deaths.

Rather than insisting that people wear special clothing when cycling or walking, we should be designing roads and streets that keep all users safe, all the time.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Cycling makes you sweaty
“People who cycle are always sweaty and need a shower when they’ve arrived”
The response

In countries with poor cycling conditions, cycling can be an exhausting affair, involving lots of stopping and starting, sprinting from one traffic light to the next, or attempting to match the speed of motor traffic to make turns. This often results in calls for workplaces to install showers and changing rooms.

But in countries which provide well for cycling, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, it is a relaxed mode of transport in which the top speed is not so important, because there are fewer delays along the route and because cycling is separated from motor traffic by design.

As a result, people can cycle as fast or as slow as they want to, and there is no more sweating involved than moderate walking for the same amount of time.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
You need lots of special stuff to cycle
“You need special clothes, bags, etc., to be able to cycle.”
The response

In countries with well-developed infrastructure which enables cycling journeys, people travel in normal clothes, without any extra equipment. Racks, panniers and baskets can carry luggage, and chain-guards and coat-guards hide moving parts from loose clothing.

The extra equipment that is often considered essential in countries with low cycling rates is due to the conditions in which people are expected to cycle, rather than something inherent to the mode of transport itself. When cycling is properly designed for, it should be as easy as walking.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People won’t or can't cycle very far
“People do all sorts of long journeys that just can’t be done by cycling”
The response

While it's obviously not practical to cycle for all journeys, many journeys which are currently made by other modes could – with the right infrastructure – easily be made by cycling.

For example, almost 40% of journeys currently made by car or van in Great Britain are under two miles (which would take about 10 minutes cycling). Half of all commuters in England travel less than three miles to work (about 15 minutes cycling).

With the right street design, most people could easily cycle those distances, with about as much effort as walking. Cycling can also make trips that are currently walked much more quick and convenient.

Good cycling infrastructure can enable some people to cycle for even longer journeys; long-distance and inter-city cycle routes are common in the Netherlands and other European countries.

While most long journeys will still be made by bus, car, or train, there is clearly plenty of scope for the vast majority of journeys, which are short, to switch modes. The fact that cycling is impractical for some long journeys is not a reason to fail to provide infrastructure to enable cycling for shorter trips.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Our roads are too narrow
“Our roads are too narrow for cycling infrastructure”
The response

In practical terms, there isn't any road – narrow or wide – that can't be made safe and attractive for cycling. The solutions aren't always politically simple, but physical space is rarely an insurmountable problem.

It is true that some roads may be too narrow to accommodate cycling-specific infrastructure alongside other uses such as parking and multiple lanes for motor traffic. However, it may well be the case that cycling infrastructure is a more beneficial and productive use of road space.

To create space for cycling infrastructure, a road might be made one-way for motor traffic, or parking could be reduced. Alternatively, the amount of motor traffic can be reduced to a very low level, making the road itself a safe and attractive place to cycle.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
It’s too hilly here
“The Netherlands is flat – that’s why they cycle a lot”
The response

The effect of topography on cycling rates is often overblown. While we would reasonably expect fewer people to cycle in very hilly areas, in most places the topography isn't as large a factor as many would believe. For example, even cities in Switzerland – not a country renowned for its flat plains – have much higher cycling rates than cities in many much flatter parts of the world.

Although the Netherlands is a comparatively flat country, this is not a reason why levels of cycling there are so high. If it were, other flat parts of the world would have similarly high levels of cycling. The Netherlands does have hilly cities, such as Nijmegen, which has levels of cycling just as high as flatter parts of the country. The real reason why people cycle in large numbers in the Netherlands is because of high-quality cycling infrastructure that makes those journeys comfortable and enjoyable.

Also, cycles with electric assistance are increasingly popular, especially with older people, and these can help ‘smooth out’ hills.

So hills aren't an obstacle to cycling much more than they are to walking, and certainly not a reason to fail to design safe and attractive streets for cycling.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Shopkeepers rely on people driving
“If we put in cycling infrastructure or pedestrianise a road, shops will get less business”
The response

Cycling infrastructure and traffic-free areas do not restrict access to shops – they can actually make streets with shops on them nicer places to visit, increasing footfall and overall demand.

Many studies – from the Netherlands in the 1970s, to big US cities in the 2010s – have found that installing cycle infrastructure does not have a negative effect on the income of businesses, and in most cases has a positive effect.

It's a popular myth that people who arrive by car spend more. People who get to the shops by cycling may spend less per visit, but they will visit more often, and they will spend more money overall. And being able to access a shop easily without a motor vehicle means that more frequent trips involving smaller ‘baskets’ become more convenient.

The headline message is: well-designed streets that make cycling and walking attractive are good for business. And in any case, cycling infrastructure won't stop people driving to shops, or parking near them and walking a short distance. The goal is not to prevent all driving, but to give people safe, sensible choices.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Shops won’t get deliveries
“If cycling infrastructure is installed, shops won’t be able to take delivery of their stock”
The response

It is possible to move goods easily across a well-designed cycleway. Parking bays are located outside the cycleway, and loading takes place across it. This happens routinely on all main roads in the Netherlands and Denmark. It's even happening now in towns and cities in other countries where cycling infrastructure has been built.

Furthermore, pedestrianised areas place severe restrictions on vehicular access, yet still manage to maintain vibrant shopping and business districts. Generally they are able to do so by coordinating delivery times, sharing delivery vehicles, making deliveries using smaller vehicles (or even cargo bikes), or by making deliveries out of hours.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
We’re not Dutch or Danish
“The Dutch and Danes have cycling in their blood, we don’t”
The response

The Netherlands and Denmark both have high levels of cycling. Some claim that this is because they are somehow temperamentally different to us, or that they have a different relationship to cycling as a mode of transport, or a different culture.

This is untrue. Car ownership is high in both countries; the Dutch and the Danes also walk and use public transport. Furthermore, immigrants to the Netherlands cycle more than they do in the countries where they come from – indeed, they cycle more than people do in other European nations.

The Dutch and Danes don't cycle because it is their manifest destiny to do so, but because they live in places where cycling is designed for, making it a convenient, safe, and obvious way to get around.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Cycling isn’t safe
“It’s unsafe to cycle and we shouldn’t promote it”
The response

Cycling is not an intrinsically dangerous mode of transport.

Danger comes mostly in the form of motor vehicles, particularly those travelling at higher speeds, and those of larger mass. That is why it is essential that good road design should separate cycling from faster motor traffic, and also from heavier vehicles like buses and HGVs. Where encounters do have to occur, they should be as limited as possible, and at slow speeds.

Even in countries with poor cycling conditions, the benefits of cycling outweigh the risks, but well-designed streets and roads also make cycling feel like a safe activity, as many studies have found that sharing space with motor vehicles on busy roads is an intimidating and scary experience for most people.

More journeys made by cycling would benefit everyone in society, through reduced pollution and an improvement in public health.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
People with physical disabilities can’t cycle
“We shouldn’t provide for cycling, as it disadvantages people with physical disabilities”
The response

Evidence from the Netherlands (and increasingly from the UK, where new infrastructure has been built) shows that high quality cycling infrastructure is often shared with wheelchairs, mobility scooters and other assistive modes of transport. Cycling infrastructure works for all these types of mobility aids.

And in general, cycling infrastructure should go hand-in-hand with other improvements to the physical environment too – like smooth, continuous footways across side roads, for example.

There are cycles available for almost every type of disability – it’s actually an inclusive mode of transport that will often act as a mobility aid for people who find walking difficult, people who can't walk far and even those who cannot walk at all.

So in fact the truth is the opposite of the myth – cycling actually gives people with physical disabilities more transport options and independence, not less.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
I’m too old to cycle
“Cycling for transport is for young, fit people – I'm too old for that”
The response

In countries where there is widespread provision for cycling separate from other modes of transport, people of all age groups and abilities cycle, and do so at a pace they’re happy with. For example, nearly a quarter of all trips made by Dutch over-65s are cycled.

Removing interactions with heavy vehicles makes almost any journey a possibility by cycle – be it a standard bicycle or something specifically for those with mobility needs, such as a hand-powered trike – and may often make trips easier than walking for those who have difficulty doing so. In addition, the increasing use of electrically-assisted “e-bikes” means that physical strength is even less of a barrier.

So in fact the truth is the opposite of the myth – cycling actually gives less-able people more transport options and independence.

===

Your cycling fallacy is…
Liability laws will make people drive safely
“It's not the infrastructure that makes the Netherlands so safe for cycling, but liability laws”
The response

The effects of strict (or presumed) liability laws on behaviour are exaggerated. These laws are simply insurance regulations, and have no bearing on criminal culpability. There is no evidence to suggest they have any effect on the behaviour of people driving, or on safety in general.

Many countries with low cycling rates (and high cycling casualty rates) also have such regulations, seemingly to little or no effect. The Netherlands didn't enact such regulations until the early 1990s, long after their cycling boom had begun.

Liability laws are a good thing in their own right, a post-trauma financial safety net to help provide support for victims of road collisions. But they're not intended to deter bad driving, nor are they a way to make cycling safe and attractive for all.
