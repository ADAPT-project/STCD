Park and Ride is available by bus and rail in the north east with seven railway stations and three bus park and ride sites providing plenty of free parking and direct and hassle free routes into the city centre.
 
Bus Park and Ride facilities are currently available at Kingswells, Ellon and Bridge of Don. All three sites are served by frequent and direct services into Aberdeen city centre. Two further sites are planned on the A96 and on the A90(S) at Portlethen tying in with the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and creating a ring of park and ride sites around the city.
