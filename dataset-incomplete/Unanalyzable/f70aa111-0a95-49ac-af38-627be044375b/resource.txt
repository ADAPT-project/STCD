Getabout is a joint project featuring several organisations who want to create a sustainable transport system and greater transport choices in Aberdeen City and Shire. 
The project features members from the regional transport partnership Nestrans, Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council, The Energy Savings Trust, NHS Grampian, Robert Gordon University and University of Aberdeen.
Working together, the partners want to promote a healthy and sustainable transport choice for everybody travelling within the region and beyond . All take steps to make active and sustainable forms of transport more accessible for their staff, their users and everybody in the north east.
By enabling you to consider options like car-sharing, taking the bus or train, cycling or walking for some trips - we can reduce congestion on the roads and everybody can enjoy the benefits. 
Did you knowÂ…?
* At present 80% of commuting cars in the north-east have only one occupant.
* Half of all car trips are under five miles, with 62% of them under two miles.
* The north east has 220,000 cars more than there are houses. Yet a quarter of the population has no access to a car at all.
