2+ car sharing FAQs
How does 2+ car sharing work?

Drivers advertise empty seats on planned future trips. By searching online, passenger(s) can make contact to organise similar or matching journeys. It can be used by individuals, groups of friends or businesses.

One of the people travelling usually owns the car and the passenger(s) will generally make a contribution towards fuel and other associated costs. The passengers(s) normally arrange a drop-off either on-route or at the driverâ€™s destination. Short diversions off route are commonly organised to pick up passengers.
What type of journeys can be made?

2+ car sharing can be used to arrange regular or one-off journeys, for both long and short distances. Each 2+ car sharing provider has a different focus, for example travel to events like festivals and football matches or students travelling to university.

2+ car sharing can also work for businesses, which can use dedicated platforms to connect employers with similar travel patterns. 
Who benefits from 2+ car sharing?

2+ car sharing helps drivers, passengers and business to economise on journey costs. It contributes to reducing congestion, carbon emissions, pollutants, car dependency and need for parking spaces. It can help to build community relations, notably benefiting rural areas by reducing social exclusion where public transport is limited.
