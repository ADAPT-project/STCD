What do members say about lift-sharing?
Norman
“It’s equivalent to a £2,500 pay rise”

“The cost of fuel makes the case for car-sharing overwhelming. I estimate my car pool keeps about £150 a month in my pocket that would otherwise glug down my filler cap. At typical levels of taxation, that’s equivalent to a salary rise of £2,500.”

Emma
“It’s good for the environment, and I feel safe doing it”

“I did an online calculation which said that my annual carbon footprint was three times that of the national average. This concerned me, so that was one of the drivers for signing up to car-share.
“When my lift-share and I first met, we agreed to meet at the local pub first of all. Just to make sure one of us didn’t have two heads or anything like that! We’ve done the same every time: whenever we add a new member to the team, we arrange to meet them first in the local pub.”

James
“It’s improved all our social lives!”

“We have all become good friends through car-sharing. There’s a lot of conversation and humour, and we regularly socialise outside of travelling to work – going to pub quizzes, go-karting and inviting each other to parties.”

Tammy
“It’s the logical thing to do”

“I was sitting alone in my car, and I could see other people in their car sitting on their own, and I thought ‘this seems crazy’. That they should be driving exactly the same way as me, arriving probably exactly the same time as me, in our own individual cars. Why aren’t we sharing?
“I’ve never had any concerns about safety. I met my lift-share before we took our first journey; I was with my husband and he was with his partner and his children, out walking in the village, and it was very easy.”
