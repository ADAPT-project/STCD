What is a car club?

The costs and hassles associated with owning a car (or two) can really add up. Insurance, servicing, MOT, tax, cleaning, parking permits, the list goes on…

But imagine if you could have access to a choice of new cars and vans parked locally to where you live, work and study, available 24/7, 365 days of the year. Vehicles which are serviced and maintained by someone else, that you only ever pay for when you need them, not when you don’t.

That’s exactly where City Car Club comes in.

Cars on your doorstep

City Car Club has a large fleet of cars and vans spread in dense networks across an ever-increasing number of UK cities (browse our car locations). Our cars and vans are parked in their own designated bays and can be reserved for as little as half an hour, a day, or as long as needed.

Reserve at a moment’s notice

The cars and vans can be reserved online, by phone or using the iPhone app, any time of the day or night* and members access the vehicles with their own smart-enabled membership card. At the end of the reservation, they are returned to the same designated bay they were picked up from, so there is always a parking space waiting for you.

Cost effective

Unlike owning a car or van, with City Car Club you only pay for the time you actually need it, so you’re not wasting money paying for a vehicle while it sits doing nothing. If you’re are someone who travels less than 8,000 miles a year, joining the car club could save you thousands on your motoring costs.

Take a look at our ‘Is it for me?’ page to find out exactly how car club membership could suit your needs.

All the convenience of a vehicle, without the hassles and expenses of owning one. That’s City Car Club in a nutshell and that’s why thousands of motorists are joining the motoring revolution every month.
