Cycle hire

Getting around by bike has recognised health benefits and, unlike driving a conventional car, does not contribute to environmental problems like air pollution and climate change. When drivers substitute their car for a bike they are also directly reducing congestion and the need for car parking spaces.

Cycle hire schemes have successfully been established in the UK, in locations including London, Glasgow, Dumfries, Liverpool and Bath. Especially practical for short journeys, cycling is often a cheaper alternative to driving.
