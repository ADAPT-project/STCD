Why walk?
Happy walkers enjoying their health walk

    Joining my local group has given me the confidence to enjoy all the wonderful green spaces that I didn't even know existed. I feel liberated.

Ever feel like it'd be nice to get out and about more often? Get a little more fresh air in your lungs? Be a bit more active? 
Lots of us wish we did more exercise. We know it's good for us. And we know our health's important. But it can be easy to find excuses for not actually getting out there and doing it: 
 

    The gym is boring / intimidating / expensive. 
    There's not enough time. 
    My knee / back / hip isn't up to it these days.
    It's no fun. 

Sound familiar?
 
Walking works
If you find it difficult to get active, why not start walking? It's really easy to get started, you don't need any special equipment - and best of all it counts towards your recommended amount of physical activity.
 
Walking can improve your health, your happiness and, if you join one of our groups, it will give you the chance to explore the outdoors, get to know your local area and meet new people.
 
The video below highlights just a few of the benefits that thousands of people across the country get from walking.

 
What's stopping you?
Sometimes a walk alone in the fresh air is just what we need. But if you're just getting started and you're not sure that you want to do all your walking alone - or if you like the idea of having other people around to help you stay motivated - then walk with us. 

    It has been one of the best things I've ever done. I feel like I've found the real me again. I'm healthier, fitter, happier, more confident and finally on the way to losing that last stubborn stone in weight.
