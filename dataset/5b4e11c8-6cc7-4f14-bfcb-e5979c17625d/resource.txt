Why car share
Whether it's a regular commuting trip or a one off trip you are making, car sharing has lots of benefits.

Go Cheaper

Regular car sharers save hundreds of pounds a year, by sharing fuel costs, parking costs and reducing wear and tear on your car (if you take it in turn to be the driver).

Don't be a lone ranger

Avoid travelling along on those boring commuting trips, find a new friend to socialise with on your regular journey to work.

Go Greener

Reduce congestion and reduce your carbon footprint by sharing your journey.

Find a way of getting from a to b

Even if you don't drive, you can car share. Car sharing can help people get from a to b where bus services aren't available.
