About walkit.com

We think walking in and around town can often be a smart choice.

No timetables to keep to, no journey delays, little overcrowding, healthy, green, free, direct, access to services (and sunlight!) en route.

We don’t in any way pretend that you can substitute walking for all the urban car/bus/taxi/tube/metro trips you make. We do, however, want to at least help you make more informed decisions about whether you choose to walk for all, or part, of any given journey.

So that’s what motivates us, and we hope will motivate you.

We’re a small company but we’ve got big ambitions. We have a rolling programme of launches in new cities and towns, and we aim to add in new functionality and make other improvements on the basis of user feedback (and the number of hours in the day!).

Please contact us with your grumbles and your praise. Tell your mates about us. Bung a walkit.com link on your website. And most importantly, get walking.

Thanks,

The walkit.com team
