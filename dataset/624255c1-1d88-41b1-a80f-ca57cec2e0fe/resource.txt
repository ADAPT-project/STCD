Trains are not just for those long trips. We have a local train service serving Aberdeen City and Shire.
 
Local services are getting better all the time. A new timetable has resulted in the biggest change to our local services in nearly 20 years, giving us for the first time a cross Aberdeen service to Dyce and Inverurie by adding peak morning services between Inverurie and Aberdeen from Stonehaven and Portlethen, as well as two extra departures during the evening commuter period.
 
More frequent services, infrastructure improvements, a new station at Kintore are committed projects and an increase in Sunday trains at Inverurie and more trains to Portlethen make it even easier to use the train. There are free car parks at all stations (apart from Aberdeen) and they all have bus links and free bike parking.
 
Planned extra tracks on the Aberdeen to Inverness line in the coming years will stimulate even more frequent and faster local services.
 
The reopening of Laurencekirk station offers commuters in the south of the region a welcome travel option. Planned improvements at Dyce station include a new station building, new footbridge and lifts and bus turning circle making links to the industrial estates and airport faster. A new station at Kintore is committed for construction all making cross city rail trips even easier.
