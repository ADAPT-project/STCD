Get active

Transport Scotland aims to get more people making active travel choices for their everyday journeys wherever possible, to improve health and the environment. That is why we have in recent years invested significantly in training, infrastructure and road safety campaigns for the benefit of cyclists through organisations such as Cycling Scotland, Sustrans and Local Authorities across Scotland.

Last September we announced another Â£20 million of funding over the next two years for investment in active travel. This funding will also help to deliver our commitment to the shared vision as reiterated in the Cycling Action Plan for Scotland 2013, that by 2020 10% of all journeys will be by bike.

It goes without saying that cycling and walking benefits the individual with not just physical benefits, but benefits for mental health, the environment and keeping people's transport costs down. Transport Scotland is committed to making it easier for more people and children to incorporate active travel choices into their daily routines.
