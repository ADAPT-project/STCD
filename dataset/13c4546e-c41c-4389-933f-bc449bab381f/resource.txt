When can I share a car?

Because of the organisation involved, car-sharing is most appropriate for pre-planned or regular journeys, including:

    Getting to and from work
    Getting to and from university
    Travelling to a festival, big event or show
    Going to the match at the weekend
    Doing the weekly shop
    Getting the children to school
    Or simply visiting friends

But you can also search for traveling companions for one-off journeys to anywhere in the country.
