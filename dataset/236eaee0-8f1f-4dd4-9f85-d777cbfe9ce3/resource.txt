Healthy bodies
Two volunteer walk leaders lead a Walking for Health walk

For lots of us, when we hear the word ‘exercise’ we conjure up visions of the gym… maybe a fitness DVD… or perhaps a competitive sport like athletics, cycling or tennis. We don’t often imagine a stroll around the park or a brisk walk to the shops. But we should – because walking is exercise too.

Walking is a normal, everyday activity – and that’s partly why we forget it’s actually exercise at all. It’s good for us. It can help us stay healthy and watch our weight. And it gives us energy (which makes us feel great). There’s really no other exercise like it! 

A 30-minute miracle
And with walking, you don’t have to do a lot to reap the rewards. The minimum recommendation from doctors to keep your body healthy and prevent illness such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes is 150 minutes of activity a week. So you could look at that as just 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week – and you can break that down into chunks of ten or fifteen minutes at a time if you like.
 
Building momentum

You don’t have to walk for a long time or at a brisk pace from day one. You can build up as you go. And it won’t be long before you start to see the benefits.

    It’s made a big difference to my life by introducing me to new things, and people for which I am eternally grateful. Walking for Health has helped me build up my fitness and lose weight – now I walk for enjoyment, not just around the supermarket.
