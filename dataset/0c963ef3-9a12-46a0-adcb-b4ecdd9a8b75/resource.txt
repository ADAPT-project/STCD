What is 2+ car sharing?

2+ car sharing, not to be confused with car clubs, is also known as ride-sharing, carpooling or lift-sharing. It is based on the premise of two or more people sharing a journey. Carplus uses the term 2+ car sharing, as in the rest of the world car-sharing is synonymous with car clubs.

How does 2+ car sharing work?

2+ car sharing, i.e. when two or more people share a car and travel together, allows people to benefit from the convenience of the car, sharing travel costs, whilst alleviating the associated problems of congestion and pollution. Lift sharing can contribute to community cohesion, connecting people with shared interests or similar lifestyles.

Online booking systems allow drivers to advertise trips, passengers seeking a lift can search for journeys. One of the people travelling usually owns the car and the other(s) will generally make a contribution towards fuel and other associated costs for journeys they are making in the same direction, on a regular or one-off basis. The passenger(s) can arrange a drop-off either on-route or at the driverâ€™s destination.
