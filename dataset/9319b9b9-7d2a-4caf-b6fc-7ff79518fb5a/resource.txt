Transport and climate change

The Climate Change (Scotland) Act sets a target of an 80 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050.

The transport sector will need to make a significant contribution towards meeting this target.

Domestic transport accounted for 20% of total Scottish GHG emissions in 2011 whilst international aviation and shipping accounted for a further 5% of total emissions.

The Scottish Government's Climate Change Delivery Plan states that we require:

"Almost complete decarbonisation of road transport by 2050 with significant progress by 2030 through wholesale adoption of electric cars and vans, and significant decarbonisation of rail by 2050."

The Scottish Government recently published its programme of strategic action to move towards a largely decarbonised transport sector in Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013 â€“ 2027 (RPP2).

This strategy focuses on:

    Decarbonising vehicles through action to advance the mainstream adoption of electric vehicles (EVs);
    Delivering more efficient use of the road network through initiatives such as the application of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS);
    Building sustainable communities with greater carbon-friendly travel options, particularly cycling and walking and;
    Engagement with businesses and organisations to promote the transition to low-carbon transport and travel, through measures such as fuel efficient driving, workplace travel planning and freight efficiencies.
