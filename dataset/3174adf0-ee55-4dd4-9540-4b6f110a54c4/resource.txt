Introduction

Getting actve and staying active is one of the best things you can do for your health. Every form of physical activity counts and doing something is better than doing nothing. 30 minutes 5 x per week or 150 minutes a week is the minimum recommended level of physical activity to keep you fit and healthy.

TAKE 30 is the Ramblers Scotland guide to walking for health and fitness. Brisk walking for 30 minutes, most days of the week, meets this recommendation and protects the body from many illnesses and conditions.

Walking is an excellent natural exercise that can help you stay healthy and live longer; control your weight; keep you happy; provide a healthy way to enjoy time with friends and family; help you learn more about your local area, and even look after the environment.

For most people walking is the easiest way to get most of the physical activity you need to stay healthy.
Walking is…

    free and requires no special equipment, training or gym or club memberships;
    available to almost everyone;
    safe and low-impact, with a low risk of injuries and accidents;
    easy to start slowly and build up gradually;
    …and it’s one of the easiest activities to fit into your everyday life.
    You can walk from your doorstep at a time that suits you.
    You can use walking for everyday short trips (to school, work, shops).
    You don’t need to concentrate on the walking itself, leaving you free to enjoy your surroundings, chat to friends and family or just relax.
    You can enjoy a variety of surroundings as you walk in different places and different seasons

All walking is beneficial, but for the greatest benefits to heart, lungs and blood pressure, brisk is best. You should be breathing a little faster, feeling a little warmer and feeling your heart beating a little faster although still comfortable and able to talk.
