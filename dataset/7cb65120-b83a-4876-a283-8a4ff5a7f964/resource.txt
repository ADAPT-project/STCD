Preventing illness
A Walking for Health group stroll through a park

If you have a health condition, walking is a great way for you to relieve some of your symptoms, get back on the road to recovery and feel great again. But it isn't just about getting better. Walking can help prevent illnesses from developing in the first place.
Brisk walking
Regular brisk walking improves the performance of your heart, lungs and circulation. It can also lower your blood pressure. And it can reduce your risk of strokes, as well as the UK's biggest killer - heart disease. 
 
A gentle pace
Even if you're not ready to walk at a brisk pace, you can take your time and build up slowly. Walking at any pace will help you to manage your weight, reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and reduce the risk of some cancers (inactive people are more likely to develop colon, breast and lung cancer than those who exercise). 
 
Walking will improve the flexibility and strength of your joints, muscles and bones too - and it'll reduce the risk of osteoporosis. 
 
We don't always think of walking as exercise - perhaps because it's so normal that we take it for granted. But walking is a great way to get active and prevent illness.
 
So if you want to get started, why not find your local health walk and join today?
