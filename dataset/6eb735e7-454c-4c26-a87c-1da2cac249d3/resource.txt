Public transport
--------------------
Taking the bus or train can often be quicker, more convenient and cost you less than the total cost of running a car. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and congestion. Which means a cleaner, healthier Scotland. Taking the bus, train, coach or subway is a great start to greener living.

Leaving the car at home lets you relax too. You don't have to worry about getting stuck in traffic. And you can work, read or just take time to think until you get there.
Benefits of public transport
-----------------------------------
* Reduced cost compared to a car - both financially and environmentally, with the option to save money by buying a season ticket that lets you use the train or bus more for a lower fare per journey
* Convenience - regular services that let you hop on and off where and when you like
* Work, read or just take a break - with no road to watch or vehicle to control, the time is all yours
* Bypass traffic jams and save time - buses can zip along bus lanes and journeys are often quicker by train than driving
* Greener - help work towards a cleaner, greener Scotland by choosing a travel option that causes less pollution
For many people, the nearest bus stop is no more than a few minutes' walk away. If you can't make your full journey by public transport, try park and ride. Drive part of the way, leave your car at the train station and finish your journey by rail. You avoid the worst of the traffic, save on fuel and reduce your carbon emissions.
