Walking Works Wonders

Walking is the most natural and simple form of movement and an excellent all round exercise.  As a nation we are walking less and less, but walking can help you to:

    Improve your general health.
    Get fit and stay fit.
    Control your weight.
    Keep happy.
    Get to know your local and surrounding areas.
    Live longer!

The best news is almost anyone can do it, anywhere and at any time, for free! You don’t need special clothing, equipment or training, it’s easy to fit into your daily life and it's natural and easy on the body. Even if you’re unfit, you can start slowly and build up gradually.

Doctors agree that regular physical activity like walking helps protect the body from many illnesses and conditions, including heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, obesity, the most common type of diabetes and many cancers.

It’s also a great way to relieve stress and stay happy. Everyone knows how a good walk can help you collect your thoughts, and being outdoors, especially in green spaces, can help fight depression and improve mental health.
