What are the benefits of sharing a car?

If you're a driver, by sharing your car you can split the cost of your journey and reduce your carbon footprint.

    Traffic jams cost the UK economy Â£5 billion every year in lost productivity
    There are 38 million empty car seats on the UK's roads every rush hour
    The average speed of traffic in London is 10 mph
    29% of children travel to school by car
    90% of London air pollution is caused by road traffic

Sharing a car:

    Reduces the costs of travelling
    Undercuts the cost of nearly all forms of transport
    Cuts congestion and pollution
    Reduces parking problems
    Is a great way of networking, meeting new colleagues and making new friends

If half of UK motorists received a lift one day a week, congestion and pollution would be reduced by 10% and traffic jams by 20%.
