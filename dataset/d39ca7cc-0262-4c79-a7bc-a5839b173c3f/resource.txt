The day-to-day travel decisions you make can have a real impact on making Scotland a cleaner, greener place to live and they could also help you to be fitter, healthier, happier and wealthier. If it's not far, leave the car, and choose active travel options like cycling or walking instead. Walking is one of the best ways to clear your head and reduce stress.  Whether you are planning your thoughts for the day ahead or walking away the stresses of the day active travel has many benefits.
Mile for mile, it's the shorter journeys by car that do the most damage to the environment. But with a little forward planning, most of these journeys could be walked. By leaving the car, you won't just cut carbon emissions and help the environment. All the evidence says you'll feel better for it too.
Did you know that children concentrate better for up to four hours after walking to school?
One in three car journeys in Scotland are less than 2 miles. Most of these are routine trips to run errands, post a letter or do the school run. If it's not far, leave the car and the benefits will soon mount up. Choosing active travel is as good for your health and wealth as it is for the places we live.
