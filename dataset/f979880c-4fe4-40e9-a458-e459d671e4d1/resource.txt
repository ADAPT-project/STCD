Do I need a car to car-share?

No, many people are happy to offer lifts in exchange for sharing the fuel costs. On the Liftshare network you can register your journey as "seeking a lift" if you don't have a car. If you cycle or walk to work, it's always good to find a car-share partner just in case one day you need a lift.
