Think about the best way to do each journey - can you save money, get fitter, be sociable just by finding a different way of getting to work, school or the shops, or visiting your friends and family?

It's not always practicable, but for short, easy trips it may be faster to walk or cycle than to use a car. Encourage healthy habits by walking your children to school or get on your bikes - give them a good healthy example.

For those trips to town or about the city the bus and train can take the strain.

Whatever the journey, mix up your transport - get active and Getabout!
