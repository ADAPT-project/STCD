You can find a walking route between any two points in and around the city – you're given a journey distance, walking time (according to your pace), a calorie burn and even the amount of CO2 you save by avoiding fuel-burning transport.
 
Walking the one-mile distance between Walker Road in Torry and Union Street in Aberdeen city centre would typically burn 86 calories and save 0.33kg in CO2 emissions.
 
A walk from Aberdeen railway station to the University of Aberdeen – at 1.7 miles - would take 33 minutes at medium pace, burn 140 calories and save 0.55kg in CO2.
 
The Getabout partners are investing in ways to increase safety and security for pedestrians. This includes projects to create new footpaths and improving the environment for pedestrians in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.
 
New pedestrian crossings are introduced where necessary and 20mph zones established in communities and around schools to make walking a safer journey.
 
The completion of new transport interchanges at Aberdeen and Peterhead, are all about making pedestrian links between different modes of transport safer and more efficient.
