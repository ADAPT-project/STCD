Cycling and walking, the benefits

Approximately 34% of all car journeys in Scotland are less than two miles in length and could be covered by bicycle or on foot instead. The benefits of more people cycling and walking include:

    easing congestion
    reducing noise pollution
    cutting exhaust emissions
    improving health
    giving us more time to enjoy our urban spaces
    saving money

For businesses and other organisations, developing a cycling and walking culture can help:

    lower organisational transport costs
    reduce the need for expensive car parking spaces increase productivity through improved staff well-being
    demonstrate a commitment to protecting the environment
    meet criteria for accreditation schemes such as the Healthy Working Lives Award and the Cycle Friendly Employer Award.

This is why Transport Scotland has provided funding to help deliver a number of new cycle routes and has produced Cycling by Design guidance for cycle routes.
